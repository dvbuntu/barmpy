## Intro

`barmpy` is the Python implementation of Baeysian Additive Regression Models, a generalization of BART, currently being researched [1].  We hope this library is useful for practictioners, enabling Bayesian architecture search and model ensembling.

Skeleton repo adapted from [BartPy](https://github.com/JakeColtman/bartpy).
